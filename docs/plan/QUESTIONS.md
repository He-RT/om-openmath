# Open questions

No blocking question for workspace initialization.

Known engineering contract checks are tracked in [DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md). Resolve them with evidence before the task that consumes the affected interface; do not silently change mathematical test expectations.

Resolved M3.2 test-fixture check: a long left-associative division chain is a wide raw Times tree (each denominator contributes Power[..., -1]), not deeply nested syntax. The depth-limit fixture now uses right-associative rules; a separate assertion retains the accepted division chain and its 1,000 factors. No plan-provided mathematical vector or expected expression was changed.
